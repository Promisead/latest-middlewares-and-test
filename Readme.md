## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for building applications with ExpressJS. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic CRUD operations to advanced features like authentication and testing. This project is intended to be a reference course to help developers stay relevant with the latest technologies in ExpressJS.

## Features

### CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Routes and controllers for creating new records.
- **Read**: Routes and controllers for retrieving records.
- **Update**: Routes and controllers for updating existing records.
- **Delete**: Routes and controllers for deleting records.

### Middlewares

- Custom middleware for logging, authentication, and more.
- Built-in middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data.

### Models with MongoDB and Mongoose

- Schema definition and model creation using Mongoose.
- CRUD operations using Mongoose models.

### Validation with Express-Validator

- Request validation and sanitization.
- Custom validation rules and error handling.

### Sessions and Authentication

- Session management with express-session.
- User authentication with Passport.js.
- OAuth integration for third-party logins.

### Hashing and OAuth

- Password hashing with bcrypt.
- OAuth integration with popular providers (Google, Facebook, etc.).

### Testing with Jest and E2E

- Unit testing with Jest.
- End-to-end testing with Supertest and other tools.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup.
